The Food Journal
Name: Rutuja Mandlik

The Food Journal is a dynamic web application that emulates the functionality of Yelp, a popular online platform that enables users to search, rate, and review businesses in their local area. This platform will cater to three main user categories: Business Owners, Customers, and Admin.

Business Owners will have the ability to create and manage their own business profiles, update their information, and respond to customer reviews. Customers, on the other hand, can browse, rate, and review businesses, providing valuable feedback to the community. User reviews will be moderated by the Admin, who will oversee all new business and customer registrations, ensuring the platform's integrity.

With this project, I aim to provide a user-friendly, robust, and intuitive interface that enables users to discover and share information about their favorite local businesses. TFJ is a high-quality solution that meets user needs and exceeds expectations.
